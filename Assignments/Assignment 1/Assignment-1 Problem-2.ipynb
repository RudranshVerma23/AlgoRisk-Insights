    "Well, it depends on the market condition at that time. If the market is favourable, having correlated stocks can be an advantage, but same goes for the unfavourable case. Having uncorrelated stocks also have an advantage, it decreases our risks. So in general, having uncorrelated stocks is recommended to avoid risks."
